## Migrations

Migrations allow you update your model schema. Migrations in Parch are handled
directly by [sequelize-cli](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/docs/migrations/#the-cli)
and the [migrator](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/docs/migrations/), however
parch-cli _does_ provide you with some convenience scripts in your [package.json](https://github.com/dylanfoster/parch-cli/blob/develop/templates/package.json#L8-L15)
